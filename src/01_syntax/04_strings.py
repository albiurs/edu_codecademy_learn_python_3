# Strings
#
# Computer programmers refer to blocks of text as strings. In our last exercise, we created the string “Hello world!”. In Python a string is either surrounded by double quotes ("Hello world") or single quotes ('Hello world'). It doesn’t matter which kind you use, just be consistent.

print("Urs")
print('Urs')
